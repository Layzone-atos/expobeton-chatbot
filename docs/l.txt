THE PRESIDENT OF THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO ü CONTEXT ü OBJECTIVES ü EXPECTED OUTCOME ü METHODOLOGY ü NEEDSvSUMMARY : Africa, the least urbanized continent but with the fastest demographic growth in the world with a population that is expected to double over the next 20 years due to the rural exodus and urban sprawl that characterize most of African cities created around urban areas. More and more, we can see that several cities in Africa are urbanizing, and Kinshasa is undoubtedly, the largest emerging megalopolis. With its 9,965 km² and a population of approximately 14.9 million inhabitants, the Kinshasa City- Province still has large unbuilt areas. It is located 284 meters above the sea level and is bordered by the Congo River which is the most important watercourse in the country and among the longest in the world. In the current city of Kinshasa, several rivers, tributaries of the river, leave from the south and throw towards the North making Pool-Malebo the only marshy vegetation in the Region whose remainder consists mainly of vegetation on sandy soil. History informs that for several years; the geographical area of Kinshasa (Kin-Malebo) has always been a crossroads of commerce and exchanges between peoples coming from upstream countries and those coming from the depths of Central Africa. Renamed Kinshasa since June 30, 1960, the former metropolis Léopoldville knows a population growth and an extension, from East to West, uncommon in the sub-Saharan part of the continent. To date, it has a population density of around 950 inhabitants per sq.km, most of which come from neighboring provinces but also from central, northern, and eastern provinces, even distant cities. Its strong concentration and historical role have earned it several twinning agreements with Brazzaville, Brussels, Tehran, Dakar, Lomé etc. The aim of these agreements was trade and cultural exchanges, but also political and scientific experiments. The Constitution adopted in 2006 consecrates Decentralization and the 25 provinces + the City- Province of Kinshasa, headquarter of the National Institutions and divided into 4 districts; TSHANGU, LUKUNGA, Mont AMBA and FUNA (this subdivision no longer has legal value because "the district" no longer exists in the nomenclature of the administrative (territorial) subdivision, composed of 24 communes.MAIN THEME: 3 POLES, 4 CITIES FOR THE CITY-PROVINCE OF KINSHASA: AN ANSWER FOR ITS MANAGEMENT This structuring is unique to the City-Province of Kinshasa. TSHANGU counts the rural communal area of MALUKU which represents 79% of the total area of the city. Although the Decentralization Law devotes important prerogatives to municipalities, it was retained through the SOSAK which is a provincial Edict adopted in 2014, the need to group the municipalities into 3 autonomous cities, taking hydrography into account. However, thanks to the twinning with some cities that already operate with this form of territorial governance or who share the same ambitions as those of the City-Province of Kinshasa, an adaptation of the policies experienced by others can promote good functioning of an administrative system adapted to its size and its population: One (1) Governor and three (3) mayors. The province and its 3 or 4 cities, which would correspond to the transformation of districts into cities. It goes without saying that the many challenges facing the city-province today, in knowledge: infrastructure, mobility, environment, fiscal resources, health, education, commerce, services, agribusiness etc., can be reorganized in such a way as to create a balance between the 3 or 4 cities by removing existing infrastructural inequalities. The existence of the Strategic Orientation Scheme for the Kinshasa Agglomeration, the acronym SOSAK, which is an enriching tool for the future of this megalopolis, should serve as a landmark in the reorganization of the Master Plan for the Kinshasa agglomeration and its surroundings. Thus, wishing to anticipate in this logic, the organizing committee of the ExpoBeton DRC Conference would like, for this edition, to involve the various actors of everyday life in this reflection which should lead to an outline of guidelines to be submitted to institutions for the implementation of the various recommendations that will emerge from it.
