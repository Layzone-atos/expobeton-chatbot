Its diversification therefore appears as a necessity that must be based in particular on the development of opportunities offered by its Corridors (processing, trade, urban and rural areas, industrial areas, energy, housing). The DRC’s mineral evacuation routes extend over approximately 2,000 km. It is therefore crucial to connect the various internal corridors, allowing the efficient transport of mining production from Greater Katanga. The deep-water port of Banana, located in the west of the country, is a major step towards the DRC’s maritime independence, offering total control over export logistics from the Atlantic Ocean, complementing the region’s infrastructure. The development of railway infrastructure, particularly through the Lobito corridors via Kolwezi (Lualaba), and Walvis-Bay via Lubumbashi (Haut-Katanga), will generate economic momentum for the regions and towns crossed. It follows that this way of proceeding will create significant economic dynamics for the cities and regions crossed.ExpoBeton DRC will highlight the strategic issue of corridors during its 9th edition, in order to encourage the government and its partners to fully exploit the potential of this area. This edition of ExpoBeton DRC will be a sharing, popularization and deepening of reflections within the technical workshops which will be organized with the contribution of decision-makers, elected officials, public administration officials, professional corporations and experts such as architects, urban planners, engineers, geographers, environmentalists, sociologists, economists and demographers, lawyers, entrepreneurs, developers, Congolese and foreign investors, road users, donors, civil society, etc. To this end, ExpoBeton DRC will count on your material and financial support to organize meetings for reflection, B2B & B2G, B2C exchanges on the themes mentioned above in order to achieve its objectives. At the end of the work, each workshop which will deal with the different sub-themes will provide its conclusions and sustainable solutions in the form of recommendations for developing the cities of the Corridors of the Democratic Republic of Congo by 2050. An ad hoc monitoring committee will be set up at the end of the work.1.CONTEXT 5 Present all development opportunities in the key sectors of mining, infrastructure, energy, housing, trade and multimodal transport, employment, agro- industry, etc. Transforming Corridors into development axes that not only provide modern, fast and competitive transport and transit services that promote trade, but also stimulate investment and encourage sustainable development and poverty reduction.
